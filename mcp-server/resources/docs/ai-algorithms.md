# ChatTTT Technical Implementation and AI Architecture

## System Overview
ChatTTT implements a sophisticated multi-layered AI system combining several technologies:
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Perfect game-tree search for optimal tic-tac-toe play
- **Language Model Integration**: Natural language understanding via Ollama
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Structured tool integration and resource management
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines deterministic game AI with conversational AI

## Core Game AI: Minimax Algorithm

### Algorithm Implementation
ChatTTT uses a classic minimax algorithm for perfect tic-tac-toe play:

```python
def minimax(self, board, is_maximizing, ai_player):
    winner = self._check_winner(board)
    
    # Terminal state evaluation
    if winner == ai_player:  return 1   # AI wins
    elif winner is not None: return -1  # AI loses  
    elif None not in board:  return 0   # Tie game
    
    opponent = 'X' if ai_player == 'O' else 'O'
    
    if is_maximizing:  # AI's turn
        best_score = float('-inf')
        for i in range(9):
            if board[i] is None:
                board[i] = ai_player
                score = self.minimax(board, False, ai_player)
                board[i] = None
                best_score = max(score, best_score)
        return best_score
    else:  # Opponent's turn
        best_score = float('inf')
        for i in range(9):
            if board[i] is None:
                board[i] = opponent
                score = self.minimax(board, True, ai_player)
                board[i] = None
                best_score = min(score, best_score)
        return best_score
```

### Minimax Characteristics
- **Completeness**: Always finds optimal move if one exists
- **Deterministic**: Same board state always produces same move
- **Perfect Play**: Never makes suboptimal moves when used optimally
- **Time Complexity**: O(b^d) where b=branching factor, d=depth
- **Space Complexity**: O(d) for recursive call stack
- **Tic-tac-toe Specific**: Maximum 9! = 362,880 game states to evaluate

### Win Condition Detection
```python
def _check_winner(self, board):
    winning_combinations = [
        [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8],  # Rows
        [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8],  # Columns  
        [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]              # Diagonals
    ]
    
    for combo in winning_combinations:
        if (board[combo[0]] is not None and 
            board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]]):
            return board[combo[0]]
    return None
```

## Natural Language Processing Layer

### Ollama Integration
ChatTTT integrates with Ollama for conversational AI capabilities:

- **Model Flexibility**: Compatible with various models (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- **Tool Selection**: AI determines appropriate MCP tools based on user input
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains game state and conversation history
- **Natural Response Generation**: Creates helpful, contextual responses

### Language Model Configuration
```javascript
const ollamaConfig = {
    temperature: 0.2,        // Low for consistent tool selection
    max_tokens: 2048,        // Sufficient for detailed responses
    context_window: 4096,    // Maintains conversation memory
    stop_sequences: [...],   // Prevents role confusion
}
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
The system uses carefully crafted prompts for different functions:

1. **Tool Selection Prompt**: Helps AI choose appropriate MCP tools
```
You are a smart assistant for a tic-tac-toe game that can select tools.
Analyze the user's request and pick an appropriate tool if there is one.
Be choosy and only select the tool that's right for the job, otherwise return 'none'.
If the user's request is a single number, you can assume the play_move tool.
```

2. **Context Integration**: Includes current game state, board layout, and chat history
3. **Resource Awareness**: AI knows about available documentation and guides

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation

### Available Tools
ChatTTT exposes four core tools through MCP:

1. **`new_game`**: Reset board state and start fresh game
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: Confirmation message
   - Use case: User wants to restart or begin new game

2. **`best_move`**: Calculate optimal move using minimax
   - Parameters: board state, player, game_over, winner
   - Returns: Position (1-9) of strongest move
   - Use case: Strategic advice, optimal play

3. **`random_move`**: Generate random valid move
   - Parameters: board state, player, game_over, winner  
   - Returns: Position (1-9) of randomly selected move
   - Use case: Educational variety, casual play

4. **`play_move`**: Execute move at specified position
   - Parameters: board state, position, player
   - Returns: Confirmation or error message
   - Use case: User specifies exact move to make

### Resource System
MCP provides structured access to documentation:
- **Game Rules**: Complete gameplay mechanics and interface guide
- **Strategy Guide**: Advanced tactics and winning patterns
- **AI Algorithms**: Technical implementation details (this document)
- **Commands Reference**: Natural language interface examples

### Tool Execution Flow

## Auto-Play Feature Implementation

### Automatic Move Generation
When auto-play is enabled:
- **State Monitoring**: JavaScript detects when it's AI's turn
- **Automatic Tool Call**: Calls `best_move` without user prompt
- **Immediate Execution**: Makes optimal move automatically
- **User Override**: Can be toggled on/off during gameplay

### Implementation Details
```javascript
async function handleAutoPlay() {
    if (autoPlayEnabled && gameState.player === 'O' && !gameState.gameOver) {
        const bestMove = await callMCPTool('best_move', {
            board: gameState.board,
            player: 'O',
            game_over: gameState.gameOver,
            winner: gameState.winner
        });
        await executeMove(bestMove.position, 'O');
    }
}
```

## Random Move Algorithm

### Implementation for Educational Variety
```python
def random_move(self, board, player, game_over=False, winner=None):
    if game_over: return -1
    
    valid_moves = [i for i, cell in enumerate(board) if cell is None]
    if not valid_moves: return -1
    
    return random.choice(valid_moves) + 1  # Convert to 1-based indexing
```

### Use Cases
- **Learning**: Shows different strategic possibilities
- **Variety**: Prevents repetitive perfect play patterns
- **Beginner Friendly**: Less intimidating than perfect play
- **Exploration**: Demonstrates various game paths and outcomes

## Performance Characteristics
